Actively devlopement version
for rk-4 time + 4th order spatial differences version

##2-24-24##
Found errors in iterating f_n arrays: To save memory, k_f arrays were not
being stored. 

rk4steps were computed at successive steps with iterated f arrays which were
updated with previous rk4step

ERROR: The iterations to the f_n then should have been of the form 
f_n = (dfdt+k_dfdt*dt/fac_1)*dt/fac_2 + f_n
but it was
f_n = (dfdt)*dt/fac_2 + f_n

Resolution: The above is now fixed by updating all but the gauss aux arrays before
a rk step
Schematically 
1-> rk4-step 1 -> udpate f_n and dfdt_n arrays
2-> update f_n arrays (expect Gamma and Sigma) -> rk4-step-2 -> update remaining f_n and dfdt_ arrays
3->.
4->.

###############################################################

ERROR: factor in rk4-step 4 is different than in steps 2 and 3

Resolution: fixed factor in trivial updates before rkstep4

###############################################################

ERROR: calling second order derivatives in rk4 steps is incorrect

Resolution: fixed calls

Pending: pbbly need to fix in CN expressions

main_rk4_multiple:launch version for big runs

-> added flux arrays for all arrays.
-> changed to using a single dummy array for all aux computes
